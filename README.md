## Definition of Done

How do we know that we're really done with a task and have not forgotten anything important? In this project, we use the following Definition of Done:

- **Functionality**: the code runs / has no defects
- **Code documentation**: the code itself is properly documented
- **Project documentation** such as README/wiki is updated where necessary
    - scope/features of project: what does this project do? How can you run it?
    - setup of project
        - data requirements (files, folders)
        - software requirements (packages, other tooling)
    - developer documentation: things like the definition of done, agreed upon standards, ...
- **Peer Review**: someone else has had a look at the code and tested it on their machine
- **Git**: the code is ready to be merged to the main branch or is already on the main branch
- **Clean Repository**: old, outdated code and files are deleted
- **Consistent code style**: code is styled consistently
- **Unit tests**
    - existing unit tests pass
    - if possible: new code is properly tested 
    - unit test coverage >xx% 
- **Standards**: no errors on coding standards (e.g. lintr, black)
